# JSFXR Importer for Godot

Automatically imports JSON from JSFXR stored in `.jsfxr` files as `.wav` files in Godot.

JSFXR doesn't support exporting `.jsfxr` files currently, so use my [personalized version of JSFXR](https://somerandev.github.io/jsfxr/) for this ([source code](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/jsfxr/tree/personal-changes)).
